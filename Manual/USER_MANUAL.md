# CrewmateA350 — User Manual

**CrewmateA350** is a virtual First Officer companion for the **Airbus A350** in Microsoft Flight Simulator. It listens to your voice, responds with audio callouts, runs automated cockpit flows, and guides you through interactive checklists — just like a real crew member.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- The EN‑US voice package must be installed to use the voice engine.
- To use the trainer app, set your Display Language to EN‑US while training (you can change it back afterward).

### Voice Modes

CrewmateA350 supports two voice recognition modes:

| Mode                   | How it works                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous**         | The microphone is always listening. Speak naturally. |
| **Push-to-Talk (PTT)** | Not implemented yet.                                 |

### Volume & Voice Sensitivity

- **Sound Volume** — Controls how loud the FO's audio callouts are (0–100).
- **Voice Sensitivity** — Lower settings are more tolerant of variations (may increase false positives); higher settings are stricter.

## Tutorial

### Assumptions

This tutorial assumes you are parked at the gate with engines off. You are the Captain and PF (Pilot Flying); CrewMate acts as PM (Pilot Monitoring).

### Typical preflight timeline (example)

- 60 min: Cockpit door and curtains opened.
- 58 min: PM takes their seat.
- 55 min: PM starts preliminary cockpit preparation.
- 40 min: PM departs for external walkaround.
- 30 min: PM returns and continues cockpit preparation.
- 25 min: PF conducts the departure briefing (enter takeoff data in the Takeoff Performance window).
- 20 min: PF calls for the COCKPIT PREPARATION flow.
- 1 min: CrewMate closes the cockpit door. PF calls for the BEFORE START checklist.

![Before Start flow pattern](Images/BEFORE%20START%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Pushback and Engine Start

- Announce each engine start (e.g., “Starting engine one”).
- When ignition is set to NORMAL, PM will start the AFTER START flow pattern. If anti‑ice will be used, flaps may be left as required.
- On hand signal from ground personnel, call for the AFTER START checklist.

![After Start flow pattern](Images/AFTER%20START%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Taxi

- PM announces when the cabin is ready.
- Check flight controls at a convenient time before or during taxi (this is done before arming the autobrake).
- Control check sequence: Full Up, Full Down, Full Left, Full Right, Rudder Full Left, Rudder Full Right.
- After the controls check, PM performs the TAXI flow pattern.
- After T.O. CONFIG pushbutton is pressed and a cabin report is received, PF calls for the TAXI checklist.

![Taxi flow pattern](Images/TAXI%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Line‑up & Takeoff

- PF calls for the Line‑up flow.
- When line‑up clearance is received and the Line‑up flow pattern is complete, PF calls for the LINE‑UP checklist.
- When cleared for takeoff, announce “TAKEOFF.”

![Line‑up flow pattern](Images/LINE-UP%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Acceleration

- The After‑Takeoff flow is triggered when flaps are retracted to zero.

![Acceleration flow pattern](Images/ACCELERATION%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Climb to 10,000 ft

![10,000 ft flow pattern](Images/AT%2010%20000%20FT%20AAL%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Descent Preparation

- PF should insert landing data in the Landing Performance window.

### 10k Descent

![10k descent flow pattern](Images/AT%2010K%20Descen.png)

### Approach

- After passing the transition level or setting the barometric reference, complete the APPROACH checklist.

### Landing

- When LDG CONF is set and a cabin report is received, call for the LANDING checklist.
- PF announces “Continue” at minima or “Go‑around - flaps” as appropriate.

### After Landing

- Disarming the ground spoilers will trigger the After‑Landing flow.
- If anti‑ice is used, flaps may remain at LDG CONF per procedure.
- After the Parking flow pattern completes, PM calls for the SHUTDOWN checklist.

![After landing flow pattern](Images/AFTER%20LANDING%20FLOW%20PATTERN.png)

### Securing the Aircraft

- After the last passenger leaves (if securing the aircraft), call for the SECURE AIRCRAFT checklist.

### Parking

- Turn off taxi lights when turning into the gate, or ask the PM to confirm.
- Shutting down the engines will trigger the Parking flow.

## Voice Commands

Speak these phrases clearly during flight. The FO uses partial matching — you don't need to be word‑perfect, but include the key phrase.

### Preflight Timer

## Tips & Troubleshooting

**The FO isn't hearing me**

- Check that your microphone is selected and working.
- Adjust the **Voice Sensitivity** setting.

**The FO keeps repeating the challenge**

- Your response didn't match the expected phrase. Listen to the challenge and use one of the phrases listed in this manual (voice matching can be tuned in settings).
- If a physical switch must be set first (e.g., parking brake), set it in the cockpit before responding.

**How do I stop a checklist mid‑way?**

- Say **"Stop checklist"**, **"Abort checklist"**, or **"Cancel checklist"** at any time.

**Can I run flows and checklists manually without voice?**

- Yes. Both can be triggered from the **Flows** and **Checklist** panels in the app UI.
