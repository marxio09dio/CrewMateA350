## Getting started

Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm
- Tauri (see https://v2.tauri.app/start/)
- .NET SDK to build `CopilotSpeech` if you need to modify it

Basic setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marxio09dio/CrewMateA350.git
cd crewmatea350
npm install
```

Run the app in development

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Build a packaged app

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Build/Publish SideCar

```powershell
.\build-sidecar.ps1
```

## Commands reference

- `format` — Run Prettier across the entire repo to apply formatting, then run `cargo fmt` to format Rust code in `src-tauri`.
- `format:check` — Run Prettier in check mode (fails if formatting is needed) and run `cargo fmt -- --check` to validate Rust formatting.
- `format:frontend` — Run Prettier only on frontend JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- `format:backend` — Run `cargo fmt` in `src-tauri` to format Rust sources.
- `lint` — Run frontend and backend linters by invoking `lint:frontend` and `lint:backend` sequentially.
- `lint:frontend` — Run ESLint over the frontend codebase to surface JS/TS lint issues.
- `lint:frontend:fix` — Run ESLint with `--fix` to automatically fix fixable frontend issues.
- `lint:backend` — Run `cargo clippy` for the Rust backend and treat warnings as errors (`-D warnings`).
- `check` — Run `format:check` then `lint` to validate formatting and linting in one step.

These scripts are defined in `package.json`; use them as shown above when preparing changes or opening a PR.

## Formatting & linting

Please run formatters and linters before pushing changes. Format and lint checks are expected on PRs.

```bash
npm run format
npm run check
```

## Pull Request process and checklist

- Fork the repository and create a branch for each change (e.g., `feat/my-feature`, `fix/typo`).
- Open a PR against `main` (or the default branch) with a clear title and description and link an issue when appropriate.

PR checklist

- [ ] Built and tested locally
- [ ] Updated documentation or flow examples when behavior changed
- [ ] Linked to the issue this PR addresses (if any)

## Questions

Contributions are welcome!

Small improvements (for example, fixing a typo in a Markdown file) are appreciated and can be submitted directly as a PR. If you'd like guidance or prefer to discuss a change first, open an issue to ask a question.

Thanks for the help!
